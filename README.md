Movie Recommendation Engine
• Used movie datasets in order to build a movie recommendation engine better suited to my tastes by using K-means clustering in Python.
• The result was an average of 15 minutes saved on movie selection.
Breast Cancer Detection
• Used a breast cancer data set from Kaggle in order to predict if the patient has breast cancer by implementing a random forest algorithm with hyperparameter tuning in python.
• The result was a model with over 90% accuracy.
