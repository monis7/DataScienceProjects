Movie Recommendation Engine
* Used movie datasets in order to build a movie recommendation engine better suited to my tastes by using K-means clustering in Python.
* The result was an average of 15 minutes saved on movie selection.

Breast Cancer Detection
* Used a breast cancer dataset from Kaggle in order to predict if the patient has breast cancer by implementing a random forest algorithm with hyperparameter tuning in python.
* The result was a model with over 90% accuracy.

Stroke Prediction
* Performed EDA on a Healthcare dataset from Kaggle in order to determine important features for predicting whether a person had a stroke or not.
* Implemented three different models and compared them. 
* Written report for the entire project with future recommendations can be found in the repository.

Traffic collision
* Performed EDA on a Traffic collision dataset from Maryland authorities to determine trends and important features for assigning fault to driver.
* Imlemented three different models and compared them. 
* Written report for the entire project with future recommendations can be found in the repository.
